# Airplane Boarding System ✈️

A simple **console-based airplane seat boarding simulator** written in Java.  
The program models a 20-row airplane with 6 seats per row (A–F) and lets the user interactively board and disembark passengers through a text menu.

## 🧠 Overview

This project was built to practice:

- Working with **2D arrays** and simple **ADTs (abstract data types)**
- Mapping between **human-friendly seat labels** (like `A1`, `C7`, `F20`) and array indices
- Handling **user input validation** and exceptions in Java

The main program (`AirplaneDemo`) provides a menu that allows you to:

1. Board every seat on the plane  
2. Empty all seats  
3. Board an individual seat (e.g., `B4`)  
4. Empty an individual seat  
5. Display the current seating layout  
6. Quit the program
